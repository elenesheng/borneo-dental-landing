      Crooked, worn-down, or discoloured teeth can make us look older than we
      really are — and affect the way we speak, eat, and carry ourselves.

      <b>Why this matters:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not every smile is suited for aligners. Some conditions are better treated
      with braces or other approaches. This pre-diagnosis ensures you only move
      forward with the right treatment.

      Before you decide on braces or aligners, take a few minutes to hear
      directly from Dr.Ghana, a DSD-trained expert with over 700 smile
      transformations under his care. <br />
      In this honest, doctor-led video, you'll learn:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> 🦷 Why traditional braces are often uncomfortable, restrictive, and
      hard to maintain
      <br /> 🦷 How crowded, misaligned teeth can age your smile and hurt
      long-term oral health
      <br /> 🦷 The real risks of delaying treatment — from worn teeth to bite
      problems and gum disease
      <br /> 🦷 Why modern aligners are discreet, comfortable, and easier to
      commit to than ever
      <br /> 🦷 What makes someone a good (or bad) candidate — and how to know
      the difference
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of our patients didn't realise their teeth were affecting how they
      looked, chewed, or aged… until it became irreversible." This isn't a sales
      pitch — it's what you need to know before making a confident, informed
      decision.
